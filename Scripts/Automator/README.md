# Combine AppleScript with Automator

Some Applescripts are best when run within an Automator Quick Action workflow; formerly called a Service. Quick Action workflows can be accessed in the Finder window, Services menu, Touch Bar, and most notably can be assigned a **keystroke shortcut**. 

>"If the task you need to automate isn’t in the list of built-in actions, you can add your own scripts, such as AppleScript and JavaScript scripts, and shell commands to your workflow. Simply add the appropriate run script action to your workflow and enter your script code or shell commands."  — [Welcome to Automator on Mac - Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/guide/automator/welcome/mac)

>”If you have a workflow you use frequently — for example, adding a watermark to large sets of images — and you want to make it easy to get to, you can create a Quick Action workflow. It will then be available from Finder windows, the Services menu, or the Touch Bar (on a Mac with a Touch Bar)." — [About Automator - Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/guide/automator/about-automator-aut6e8156d85/mac)
